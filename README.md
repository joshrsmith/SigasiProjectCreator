SigasiProjectCreator
====================

This project offers Python classes that make it easy to generate a Sigasi Project from your own project
 specifications. The `SigasiProjectCreator.py` file has four classes that you can use to create the project file and
 the corresponding Library configuration files. In most cases you will need the `SigasiProjectCreator` class.

This repository also contains a few example scripts that create `.project` and `.library_mapping.xml` files and the `.settings` folder from various inputs (csv-file, list). See test-files for example input.

See <http://insights.sigasi.com/manual/projectsetup.html> and <http://insights.sigasi.com/tech/one-design-one-folder.html> for multiple ways to setup a project.
